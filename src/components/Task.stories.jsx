/*To tell Storybook about the component we are documenting and testing, we create a default export that contains:

component -- the component itself
title -- how to group or categorize the component in the Storybook sidebar
tags -- to automatically generate documentation for our components
excludeStories-- additional information required by the story but should not be rendered in Storybook
args -- define the action args that the component expects to mock out the custom events 
To define our stories, we'll use Component Story Format 3 (also known as CSF3 ) to build out each of our test cases.
